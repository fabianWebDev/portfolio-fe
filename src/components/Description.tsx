                Hi, I’m Fabián Campos — a software engineer with more than 6 years of experience building solid, intuitive, and results-driven web solutions. I specialize in backend development with Python and Django, as well as frontend development with React. I enjoy turning complex ideas into clean, functional, and well-structured applications by combining logic, design, and best development practices.

                <span>Wizard of Code</span> isn’t just a catchy name with a magical ring to it — it’s a work philosophy: solving problems efficiently, sustainably, and with purpose. I believe software is a tool to improve lives, streamline processes, and connect people. I fully commit to every project, bringing both technical and human insight, because it’s not just about making things work — it’s about making them work well and with meaning.
